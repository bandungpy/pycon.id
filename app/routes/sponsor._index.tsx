        <h3>Sponsorship Prospect and Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          What better place to find Python developers than a gathering of 250 of
          them? If youâ€™re hiring, PyCon is the place to be. The conference has
          long been a great way to find the talented developers so many
          companies are searching for, so much that we added on-site Job Fair to
          make it even easier.

            Branding, it is an opportunity to appeal that your company is
            technology-oriented organization. The posting of the logo will be
            recorded by movie and will be broadcasted on the web-media
            afterwards, leading to branding of the company and products.
            Continuous exposure of names and logos of companies, products, and
            services can generate many merits even after this conference, such
            as appeal to participants, topicality and exciting experience.

            Marketing, it's a great chance to advertise your products and
            introduce detailed usages directly to Python engineers and Python
            users. Specifically, it is possible to have more interaction to
            participants by having a booth and directly explaining, having a
            talk session, and by distributing leaflets and goods.

            Audience, PyCon's ever diversifying audience puts your organization
            in front of a wide variety of people. From beginners to experts,
            PyCon draws attendees from those with zero experience all the way
            through a significant group of the contributors to the language
            itself. We also see people of all levels from many industries. From
            developers to managers, executives to owners, startups to big
            businesses, PyCon draws attendees from all sorts of places. Some
            organizations send entire teams, and in the case of many startups,
            the entire company may be there.

            CSR, sponsoring can show your gratitude for Python community. It's
            one of CSR activity that supports technology companies and engineers
            community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexibility, if you want to help PyCon, we want to help you
            construct a sponsorship package that fits your needs. If a small
            booth would work better than a large one, perhaps we can swap it in
            exchange for another benefit that works better for your
            organization. For some organizations, a booth is not practical at
            all, but adding another conference pass may work better.
